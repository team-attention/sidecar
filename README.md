## Why Code Squad?

Vibe coding is amazing... until you review the changes.

AI writes fast. Too fast. Files pile up, changes scatter everywhere, and suddenly you're juggling tabs, hunting diffs, fixing things by hand. The conversation breaks. The momentum dies.

**Code Squad keeps the conversation going.**

One seamless flow — talk to AI, review what it built, give feedback, keep building. All in one place, without breaking the rhythm.

---

## Features

**Unified View**
All AI outputs — code, docs, configs — organized in a single panel. No more hunting through files.

**Inline Comments**
Select lines, leave feedback, send to AI. Talk to AI in context, not in a separate terminal.

**Structured Diffs**
Changes grouped by function, class, or module. See the intent, not just the diff.
