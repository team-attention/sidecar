/**
 * Webview Main Entry Point
 *
 * This file is kept for backwards compatibility.
 * All webview logic is now in the bundled script (webview-entry.ts → dist/webview.js).
 *
 * The bundled script includes:
 * - Shiki syntax highlighter (webview-entry.ts)
 * - Application logic (webview-app.ts → core/App.ts)
 * - All UI components (components/*)
 * - State management (state/*)
 * - Utilities (utils/*)
 */

// No longer exporting inline script - all logic is in the bundled webview.js
